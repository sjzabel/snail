# Snail
![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/sjzabel/snail.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sjzabel/snail)

Another Midi framework (because we need another one !!1!)

## Rational

- I wanted to work with Python 3.4
- I wanted to try out Sphinx and Jekyll
- I wanted to see how TDD with Travis-CI worked out
- I wanted to have layers of libraries instead of a monolithic one


## Project layout

More to come (I'm srsly in initial development... I just wanted to "do
the right thing" and start this project with TDD and documentation (or
as my friend said "Do responsible adult programming"))
